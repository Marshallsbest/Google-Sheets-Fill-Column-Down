# Google-Sheets-Fill-Column-Down
This is a little script I wrote which will create a new menu in which you can initiate the fillDown function. This will prompt you for a column number (A=1, B=2, etc) . The script then looks for a value in the cell then for every empty cell beneath it it will paste in the contents of the cell above it. If the Next cell has content it will copy that cell and paste  the contents in the cell below it. This is a very useful function when trying to manage exported product data from shopify or any other ecommerce platform where there is a variable product where the main product line holds all the values pertinant and you want tose values represented on each line of that product. if you want to test it on Dummy Data to get a sense of how it works, simply copy the code in to the script editor of a new Google spread sheet. save it and refresh the spreadsheet  window. fill in random cells in a column then activate the function from the new menu now displayed the results are obvious and easily describe the purpose of this script. if you feel like contributing or offering suggestions I am eager to learn as i am new to coding so please do not hesitate to contact me with your thoughts.
